Assignment is not finished

Main problems I had:
Had trouble getting rid of jquery and css errors...errors due to linking the files.  I copied other files with no luck, will follow up with a TA in class because I cant tell why I couldnt link the files correctly...


Items needed to complete app:

jquery in app.js to move burgers to new div to signify eaten.  
 - would do by adding a data attribute, devoured is defaulted to false, set to true on click of button and move html element to another div

 - complete post request to add new burgers

 - add css styling to make it less bland
